Welcome to the Feed Reader application! This application requires the following files:

index.html
icomoon.css
normalize.css
icomoon.eot
icomoon.svg
icomoon.ttf
icomoon.woff
style.css
app.js

Copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine, then load the index.html
file in your browser. The application will then be loaded.

The fourth file, feedreader.js, requires Jasmine to run, which is already
included in this application's files. The feedreader.js file will run a series of tests
to ensure the application is running correctly.
